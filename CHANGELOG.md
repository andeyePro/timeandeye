# Changelog

## 2026-06-11

- [x] **Ambitick v0.1 pre-alpha (overnight build)** — Full first implementation
  from the approved spec, e6a62dd..HEAD. `AmbitickCore`: domain models, OP URL
  parsing, naive-Bayes learning store, status/recency/time-of-day ranking,
  attribution with OP task-priming and OP-host fallback, dominant-minute
  session resolution, journal protocol, OpenProject v3 client (1-based page
  pagination), threshold-gated sync, copy-paste AI assist, settings.
  `AmbitickMac`: raw-sqlite3 journal (passes the same conformance suite),
  Keychain key storage, sensors (frontmost app, AX window titles, Chrome/Opera/
  Brave tab URLs via Apple Events, idle, sleep/wake, mic-in-use), app
  controller with 1 Hz→per-minute menu cadence. `AmbitickApp`: SwiftUI
  MenuBarExtra popover, review window (multi-select assign), settings UI.
  `scripts/make-app.sh` wraps it as ad-hoc-signed `Ambitick.app` (LSUIElement).
  56 checks green via `swift run AmbitickCoreChecks` — a plain-executable
  harness because the build Mac has CLT only (no XCTest/Swift Testing).
  Verified on Mac over scoped SSH (`ambitick` standard user). UI smoke testing
  deliberately deferred to Martin (README checklist): no GUI session available
  to the build user.
